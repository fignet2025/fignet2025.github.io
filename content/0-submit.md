### Call for Abstracts
Fignet accepts abstracts related to:
- new empirical work
- recently published papers
- under review (e.g. arXiv preprints)
- works in progress


### Submission Guidelines

We accept submissions of at most three pages (including references and images), in PDF format. Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s), and e-mail address(es) on the first page. 

Accepted works will be selected by the program committee according to adherence to the workshop theme, clarity and scientific quality. 

Presenters of accepted contributions must register for NetSci2025. Note that NetSci enforces a mutual exclusivity policy, meaning works cannot be submitted both to the main conference and this satellite.

Please send your contribution via EasyChair below.
